                        software development methods. Everything ranging from 
                        UI/UX to back-end development. I’m looking forward to starting 
                        my career within the creative industry and to help develop fun 
                        and engaging applications. In my spare time I also work on art 
                        commissions which has developed both communicative and 
                        client-facing skills.</p>

                        The emphasis on teamwork throughout most

                        During my studies, I have been advancing

                        learned new kinds of development tools

                    <p>
                        I cleaned a Betfred shop after closing every day of the week. 
                        This included: Making the shop presentable for customers and 
                        staff for the next day, vacuuming, wiping surfaces and cleaning 
                        the lavatories. This was a key holder position with flexible 
                        hours, allowing me to clean any time between the shop closing
                        to it opening the next day.

                    <p>
                        Cleaned and stocked a wide variety of wards and rooms: 
                        Surgery rooms and patient wards to offices and lavatories. 
                        Time management, organization and self-initiative was 
                        hugely important to complete the cleaning schedule 
                        successfully and correctly. Individual and team effort was 
                        needed to accomplish different tasks.

                        I was welcomed back the following summer. I 
                        continued to advance my previously gained skills and 
                        knowledge and was a reliable and flexible team member for 
                        the cleaning department. I was trusted with more difficult
                        tasks such as the emergency surgery ward which relied on
                        me being on-call to quickly and neatly clean between
                        unscheduled and scheduled surgeries.

                        I acquired communicational and teamworking skills and
