                    <p>
During my university course, I completed a year-long paid sandwich placement at Microtech Group between 3rd and 4th year. I contributed to the development of innovative software solutions for Microtech Health products like the SurgeryPod, HealthPod, and Health Portal. These products leveraged the ASP.NET Core environment in C# and Xamarin.Forms for UWP and Android mobile solutions. Over time, my responsibilities grew in complexity and I became proficient in the company’s development environment. I was tasked with new front-end and back-end features, optimising system performance, and implementing security measures. Examples included are rewriting database queries for performance improvements and serving as the primary problem solver for security issues identified during third-party penetration testing. I acquired a range of personal skills and learnt about the professional environment as a software developer. I held demos of my completed tasks and partook in the daily standup meetings. In addition, I was also part of the AI/automation meetings held within the company to improve company processes.                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Key Projects:</h3>
                    <p>
                        An example of a project I worked on at Microtech was the development of a videoplayer, implemented from scratch in UWP and Android as no existing library met the system criteria. This was within the first three months of my placement. An interface and back-end processes where fully developed by me, with the help of a senior colleauge. This was further developed on the Health Portal to manage uploaded videos, and in the process I was introduced to Azure Storage and the use of storage blobs in the API. Another example is a project implementing system alerts. This was a feature for the system admins to add alerts for such as password expiry or other SQL or API calls, based on a timed setting. The alerts would be emailed to recipients when the check criteria was met.
                    </p>
