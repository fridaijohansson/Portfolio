              <h1>Networking</h1>

              <h2>What is networking?</h2>
              <p>Networking is a term used to describe the act of meeting and building professional relationships with employers, peers, and clients in the industry. Networking is a form of marketing not only for companies but for individuals wanting to establish themselves in the industry.</p>
              
              <h2>Why is networking important within the creative industries?</h2>
              <p>
                The creative industry is competitive and there are many people with the same or more experience than you. So, why should an employer choose you for their role when there are possibly better choices? Well, if you have shown interest in their company or studio by attending networking events or connected with them on LinkedIn, there is a chance that they recognise you and hopefully enjoyed talking to you. If that’s the case, then they are more likely to give you a chance. Even if you don’t get the job, they will consider you for future roles within the company. 
              </p>

              <h2>Networking in Person vs Online</h2>
              <img id="networking1" src="blog-img/img8.jpg" alt="online networking">

              <p>
                There are multiple ways of networking. As a student, you can attend student fairs which invites employers to represent their company and provide students a chance at introducing themselves and ask questions. Another way of networking is to attend local community events or clubs that anyone with an interest can attend. These types of events allow people to give talks about their projects, discuss technologies, or to just socialise. 

              </p>
              <br>

              <p>
                Nowadays, online networking has become more prominent by attending online meetings and events. Just like the in-person communities, there are online communities which you can join and share your work, ask questions, or share your expertise. By being a regular on an online forum, you will eventually be remembered and recognised. You can read more about creating an online presence here! However, attending in-person networking events are preferred as it simulates real life working for a company. Getting to know employers and employers getting to know you, is also much easier face to face. However, after covid-19 more and more companies have moved completely or partially online.
              </p>

              <h2>Where do you start?</h2>
              <h3 id="net-text">Before you start attending networking events you should consider the following: </h3>
              <ul>
                <li>How would I efficiently introduce myself to make a great first impression? </li>
                <li>What does my ideal workplace look like?</li>
                <li>Are there networing events near me?</li>
                <li>Which companies interest me the most and what events will they attend? </li>
                <li>What technologies do these companies use?</li>
                <li>What are my qualities and skills and how would I benefit that company?</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Now you can start forming further in-depth questions you would like the ask the company. Do your research for any company you are interested in beforehand. Take notes of specific soft skills, technologies, or roles that you can reference when talking to the representative. Being well read will show the company that you are truly interested. No one likes to have their time wasted. To help break the ice, write down a short introduction about yourself, no more than 2 or 3 sentences, and practice it. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Along with knowledge, you should take extra measurements to look presentable when networking. Dressing formally or smart casual will help show that you mean business. But don’t be afraid of showing your personality though. Employers want to work with well-rounded people who work well professionally but can also fit in socially within their company. 
              </p>
              <div id="tip">
                <p></p><span class="blog-text">Tip!</span>  Employers might not take CVs at networking events, instead, you can bring business cards to hand out. This makes you stand out from the crowd and give the employer the option to search you up after the event. Be sure to include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Your name, </li>
                  <li>the job role you identify with the most,</li>
                  <li>your Email,</li>
                  <li>and the URL for any website portfolio you have.</li>
                  <li>Also, let them know they can find you on LinkedIn.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <h2>Networking online</h2>
              <p>
                Online can look slightly different to in-person but the basics remain the same. There are online events you can attend but instead of walking up to an interesting person, you have to participate in a group discussion with people. Usually, the event will start off with a presentation from the host and then smaller groups will form for an easier discussion. Therefore, having an introduction ready about yourself will help you ease into it. Don’t be afraid to speak up first! A camera is also highly recommended as it helps to simulate a face-to-face meeting. It also puts a face to the voice which will help remember you if you meet again.

              <h2>What happens after?</h2>
              <p>Having a well-rounded online presence will help you following up your networking effort. An employer will most likely have referred to open roles or people within the company. You can then find these people online, on example LinkedIn, and follow up on any questions you have. Then by applying to the referred roles it is possible that they recognise you which can help you in the application process. Even if you don’t get the job, you can be put on the backburner until they open up a better suited position for you. <a class="in-text-link" href="online.html" target="_blank">Click here to find out how to create an online presence here!</a> </p>

              
              <h2>Networking Platforms</h2>
              <p>
                LinkedIn is the most popular and easiest professional networking platform. It is like a professional Facebook. On your profile you can include all of your experience and skills, the job titles you have had, a small biography of who you are and if you are currently looking for work. Similarly, to Facebook, you can make posts, like and share other’s posts and connect with interesting people. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Other platforms used for professional networking but not their primary purpose is Twitter, Facebook, and reddit. By joining and being an interactive member in communities on Facebook or reddit is a form of networking, although might not be as successful in finding work. It does provide you with peers and eventually friends within the industry which can be beneficial when looking for jobs or advice. Twitter is great for displaying your work and promoting yourself which can lead to interested user to network with you. There are also a range of online video meeting platforms that are used by companies and events, including Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and discord.
