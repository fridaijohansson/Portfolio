                <h1>Freelancing</h1>
                <p>Monday, 3 October 2022 | by Frida Johansson</p>

                <h2>What does it mean to be a freelancer?</h2>
                <p>
                  Freelancing is a form of self-employment where the individual is the sole responsible for the work they produce. A freelancer can do commissioned work for clients or contracted work as part of a larger project in collaboration with studios and companies. Effectively, being a freelancer, you are the boss of yourself which means that the work, the hours you work, and value of that work, are up to you. Along with producing work, a freelancer within the creative industries needs to allocate time to develop and improve new skills to further their career and stay up to date with the technology in the industry. There are a few key skills and tools which are necessary to be a well-rounded freelancer:
                </p>
                
                <ul id="free-list">
                  <li>Being organised and effectively manage your time spent on working, learning, and marketing yourself. </li>
                  <li>You are providing a service, so being communicative, flexible, and quick thinking to solve any issues that may arise for the client or your work. This will leave a good impression which boosts your reputation within the industry allowing for more work in the future.</li>
                  <li>Along with these skills, being a great team member is important but even more so when your work is limited within a project. You want to bring your best foot forward by being attentive and understanding when working with new people.</li>
                </ul>
                <div id="image">
                  <img src="../img/blog-bg2.jpg" alt="img12" />
              </div>
                <p>
                  The creative industry is competitive as there is unlimited number of developers who decide to go this route. Due to the access to internet, means that a client can access whomever they want around the world for the best possible choice for them. The choice is unlimited. Therefore, a freelancer must always aim to learn new technologies and follow trends to get a higher chance at work. This can be difficult as a freelancer needs to manage their time to be able to produce the clients work but also put time aside for new skills and technologies or personal projects.
                </p>

                <h2>Promoting yourself as a freelancer</h2>
                <p>
                  Being a freelancer can be very demanding and difficult, however, with the right strategy and plan put in place, finding, and managing work could be made a lot easier. Freelancing is highly recommended to be built on a few years of experience due to the benefits of forming industry connections and building up an experienced skillset. Having industry connections already is great when you have decided to start freelancing. These connections might have developed through internships or employment, online, or networking events. By showcasing your freelance status by updating your profiles and communicating with these connections, you will encourage them to keep you in mind for future work or recommend you to their connections. 
                </p>
                <div id="div-freelancing">
                  <h3>But what do you do if you don’t have any or very few industry connections? </h3>
                  <p>
                    Resilience and hard work alongside a strong online presence could still get you a job. However, building up an online presence take dedication and time. Being regulars in relevant online or in-person communities can help present job opportunities once you have gone over to freelancing. With recognition and a good reputation people are more likely to come to you for smaller jobs. These smaller jobs are great to include in your portfolio once you start applying for freelancing work at larger companies. <a class="in-text-link" href="online.html" target="_blank">You can read more about creating a good online presence here!</a> You can also find out more about the steps you can take to meet new people by <a class="in-text-link" href="networking.html"  target="_blank">learning how to start networking</a>.
                  </p>
                </div>
                
                <p>
                  Along with your technical skillset, your soft skills and your reputation is as an important aspect of getting a job. Soft skills are required to work in a professional environment effectively and collaboratively. For a freelancer, showcasing the key skills mentioned above will help you be pursued by a company.   
                </p>
                <h2>Large studio vs small studio</h2>
                <img id="workplace" src="blog-img/img11.jpg" alt="workplace">
                <p>Before you consider becoming a freelancer, you should consider the workplace alternatives. Working for a larger or smaller companies have advantages and disadvantages that might suit you and your future career better. </p>
                <p>Large studios provide a stable and less demanding job. Having teams of tens or hundreds that allows the work to be distributed between. Larger companies also have a more robust system put in place. They might work on multiple projects at once and can have multiple clients which makes the economic stability robust. Sick leave and holidays will not have a large effect on the projects as there are chances of distributing work elsewhere. On the other hand, this also means that you can be seen as replaceable. The large atmosphere can discourage passion for your work as you might not have as much say in it.</p>
                <p>
                  Smaller studios automatically create a sense of intimacy by collaborating and working in a close nit team. This atmosphere and close collaboration can encourage passion for the work knowing you have a say in the final product. This also means that your responsibilities will include more than just one area of development. For a small company everything is more dependent on the completion of your work, otherwise the studio falls apart, in a sense. Therefore, taking time off or getting sick would influence the project, its timeline, and your salary.
