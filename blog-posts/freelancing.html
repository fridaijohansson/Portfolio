                <h2>What does it mean to be a freelancer?</h2>
                <p>
                  Freelancing is a form of self-employment where the individual is the sole responsible for the work they produce. A freelancer can do commissioned work for clients or contracted work as part of a larger project in collaboration with studios and companies. Effectively, being a freelancer, you are the boss of yourself which means that the work, the hours you work, and value of that work, are up to you. Along with producing work, a freelancer within the creative industries needs to allocate time to develop and improve new skills to further their career and stay up to date with the technology in the industry. <br><br> There are a few key skills and tools which are necessary to be a well-rounded freelancer:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Being organised and effectively manage your time spent on working, learning, and marketing yourself. </li>
                  <li>You are providing a service, so being communicative, flexible, and quick thinking to solve any issues that may arise for the client or your work. This will leave a good impression which boosts your reputation within the industry allowing for more work in the future</li>
                  <li>Along with these skills, being a great team member is important but even more so when your work is limited within a project. You want to bring your best foot forward by being attentive and understanding when working with new people.</li>
                </ul>
