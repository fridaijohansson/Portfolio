              <h1>The Importance of IP rights</h1>

              <h2>What is Intellectual property?</h2>
              <img id="pp" src="blog-img/img12.jpg" alt="private property">
              <p>
                Intellectual property, also known as IP, is the unique inventions created by the imagination of an individual or group of people. IP can be functionality, design elements, literary or musical works, symbols, names, or images, to name a few. There are ways to protect these inventions from wrongful usage such as stealing or copying. To properly protect IP and to officially assign the owner the rights to the invention, you have to apply to register it. The rights are official when the application has gone through and has become registered. There 3 main alternatives depending on what you want to register.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="blog-text">Copyright -</span>  Apply to artistic works, sound recordings, films, and broadcasts. This provides the rights to  economically, proprietarily, or morally control the usage of the material. Copyright can be bought and licensed to be transferred to another owner which allows the owner to limited use of the material. An example of this is when a book is being remade into a movie, the movie company must then buy the film rights for that book from the book’s author.
              </p>
              <p>
              <span class="blog-text">Patents -</span>  Apply to specific functionalities or design of a new invention. This can include hardware such as machinery, product design, technical software, or chemical engineering, to name a few. The application has to be fully detailing the functionality of the product whilst being totally unique. A patent gives the owner protection for up to 20 years and the rights are restrictive to the application document. There are 4 types of patents: Novel, useful, non-obvious, and patentable subject matter. 
            </p>
            <p>
            <span class="blog-text">Trademark -</span>  Apply to brand or business property, such as logos, text, colours, or sounds. Trademarking a brand will prevent the look of the company to be stolen or copied by other brands. However, to be able to register a trademark, the property cannot be:
            </p>
            <ul id="trademark-list">
              <li>Offensive,</li>
              <li>misleading, </li>
              <li>make use of official emblems, hallmarks, or national flags, </li>
              <li>be too common or non-distinctive</li>
              <li>include goods and services or a simple shape of an item or product.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>IP rights in Software development</h2>
            <p>Within software development, intellectual property is computer code or programs that has been invented or licensed to a company. Instead of using copyright or patents a company can choose to keep the IP as trade secrets. Trade secrets apply to processes, tools, mechanisms, or formulas in which a company use to have an advantage over competitors. The product of a company can be copyrighted or patented, however, how the product is made can be a trade secret. As long as the owner makes effort in keeping their trade secrets confidential, and no one independently discovers it by spying or stealing, the trade secret can be protected by the law. On the other hand, the process or tool can be revealed by anyone genius enough to have figured it out themselves.</p>

              <h2>License managing system</h2>
              <p>
                Permits provided through licence management systems can be issued to authorise controlled usage of the technology. Companies use different models of licensing management systems depending on their software and work environment. 
              </p>
              <h3>Types of License managing systems:</h3>
              <dl>
              <dt>Licensing hardware: Dongles or USB keys </dt>
              <dd>A physical device such as a USB is inserted into the computer to allow usage of the intellectual property. The physical device allows the user to access and use the software. </dd>

              <dt>Software node locked, host locked, or single-use licenses</dt>
              <dd>This licence is already integrated with the downloaded software and no physical device is needed to access it.  </dd>

              <dt>Floating, network, or concurrent licenses</dt>
              <dd>This type of license is available to multiple users within a network and can be accessed through multiple devices. Like the previous one it is downloaded along with the software. This is highly effective in protecting IP usage online.</dd>

              <dt>Named user, per-seat, or single-seat licenses </dt>
              <dd>This is common for application products such as Adobe programs. Identifies the authorised users through a login system. A per-seat licence provide licences for a larger group using the same program.</dd>

              <dt>License borrowing or offline licenses </dt>
              <dd>Limited offline licenses that can be given out to employees with unstable internet connection. The license is given back once it is no longer needed.</dd>

              <dt>Hybrid models </dt>
              <dd>The mentioned models can all be used by one company allowing for hybrid models to take place. Hybrid models provides the fitting licensing to different software’s and work environment needs. </dd>

            <h2>Does IP stifle creativity in the creative industries?</h2>
            <p>
              There are advantages and disadvantages to creativity relating to IP. Point of views and motivations can impact the answer to this question. On one hand, IP can help smaller entities gain acknowledgement and recognition for their creations or property. It can also prevent copycats with larger following to steal their ideas and profit off of it and if they do, the owner of the IP can take them to court. Although, that could be expensive and difficult standing up to a company that can put  heavy resources into winning, but that’s another topic. Nevertheless, this can encourage smaller creators in applying for protection and getting signed the rights to the IP. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, it also provides companies with protection of unique ideas and processes. This can help them succeed within the industry and reach a wider consumer base. More benefits include the financing and marketing of the product. Having a novel product means more people will be interested in it, from sponsors and companies to consumers. <span class="in-text">BUT</span> influential companies can take this one step too far. It becomes more about the money than the integrity as larger companies see their chance at profiting from what they deem unfair use. Some tried to trademark common words and symbols, some even somewhat succeeded. Here are a few examples 
              <a class="in-text-link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/15-ridiculous-trademarking-attempts-2011-4?r=US&IR=T#in-addition-to-your-pictures-and-personal-information-facebook-owns-the-word-face-13" target="insider">“face” (Facebook)</a> ,

            </p>
            <p>
              On the other hand, if IP didn’t exist then everything would be fair use. That could encourage smaller companies to mimic larger successful companies’ logos or products. That could either be positive or negative. If the same chances at producing and creating something was given to everyone, eventually someone would invent the next great phenomenon. But it could also be a negative, companies will ride of other companies backs enough to make a living. From another point of view, larger entities would steal smaller entities’ designs and use them as their own. An example of this is happening today within the fashion industry where big companies come across a design by an independent entity and use it on their products without remorse. <a class="in-text-link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/06/they-took-my-world-fashion-giant-shein-accused-of-art-theft#:~:text=Dozens%20of%20people%20have%20posted,should%20be%20flattered%20or%20mad.%E2%80%9D" target="_blank">This Guardian article is a worthy mention</a>.

            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="in-text">I don’t believe there’s one answer to the question.</span> What can stifle creativity is economic circumstances and if anything, IP protects creativity by helping IP owners profit off their creation. If an independent individual come up with a unique product they can then protect and eventually monetise that product. If this goes well it can encourage the individual to keep creating due to more of an economic freedom and previous success. In addition to this, if the registering doesn’t go through, the individual might try harder to find a more unique way to make the product. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Everything is based or influenced by something. If the one who invented the phone tried suing every attempt at new versions of it, then that would interrupt the evolution of technology. But that’s also why IP has a time limit, to allow new creations to be made using existing technology. Although, IP protection can last up to hundreds of years.
