                <h1>Professionalism within the Creative Industry</h1>
                <p>Thursday, 29 September 2022 | by Frida Johansson</p>
            </div>
            <section id="blog-section">
                <h2>What is professionalism?</h2>
                <p>Professionalism is the ability to contribute to a working environment respectfully and responsibly. Opposing prejudice towards people and backgrounds by engaging in a professional environment in which the primary focus is to produce the expected work.  It is about being truthful of your ability to do the work and follow through on your obligations and rectify any mistakes. Along with this, it also means you should follow the codes of conduct within your profession and the workplace. Integrity is part of professionalism. It is about doing the right thing even when no one is watching and aligning your actions with your words. 

                </p>
                <div id="image">

              </div>
                <h2>Why does professionalism and integrity matter in the creative industries?</h2>
                <p>Professionalism is about building up a reputation of reliability and producing high-quality work. In an industry that is creatively demanding, it can be difficult to find motivation or inspiration. Creative motivation along with passion and ambition can take projects to new heights. However, you cannot only rely on this, therefore, professionalism is important to motivate completion of work to remain a reliable team member and employee.</p>
                <p>
                  Creativity and unique ideas are well sought after, therefore, integrity is required when working with such ideas and intellectual property. Integrity combats the biases and personal ambition that can and will affect a workplace environment and the reputation of a company. This can also have legal consequences when, for instance, the lack of integrity leads to stealing or selling trade secrets for their own benefits.  
                </p>
                <p>
                  Furthermore, integrity puts a standard on how work should be produced and how to behave in a professional setting. By choosing an ethical software developer you know that you will receive a high standard of work and engagement, creating an inviting and respectable collaboration. This shows that the company values and respect their clients which positively affects the company’s reputation within the industry. The same goes for you as an individual! 
                </p>

                <h2>Codes of Conduct</h2>
                <p>
                  Ethical behaviour is commonly enforced in software development by following codes of conduct or pillars of professionalism. W3C: Codes of ethic and professional conduct, include the basics of creating a positive work environment. Different methodology and frameworks exist to help these behaviours be exercised in different professional settings. These frameworks are mainly used as project management tools to help efficiency and collaboration in the workplace. SCRUM is part of the Agile umbrella term which is an example of project management in software development. However, the values remain more or less the same throughout these methodologies. 
                </p>

                <h3>SCRUM's 5 Values:</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li><span class="in-text">Openness –</span> Being open and honest about your ability to perform and produce work is highly important to combat latency by identifying possible issues in a project. It lets your team members know what to expect from you and what they can do to help. Team leaders’ transparency will help set up a collaborative environment from the start.</li>
                  <li><span class="in-text">Courage –</span> With openness comes courage. You show courage by being honest and asking for help. But also standing up if you believe something to be done differently. Team leaders can be great examples by standing up to stakeholders and demanding clients who are unaware of the software development process.</li>
                  <li><span class="in-text">Respect –</span> Just as mentioned earlier, respect is crucial when engaging with fellow co-workers and their contributions.</li>
                  <li><span class="in-text">Focus –</span> To reach the common goal, every team member needs to be focus on the work to be done. By minimising the number of tasks at a time allows more focus on the current task. Engaging together in team meeting can help motivation to stay focused.</li>
                  <li><span class="in-text">Commitment –</span> Commitment is shown by working together as one unit. Trusting each other to contribute their best work and working towards achieving the common goals. </li>
                </ul>
