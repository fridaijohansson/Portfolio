                <h1>Professionalism within creative industries</h1>
                <p>Thursday, 29 September 2022</p>
                <p>by Frida Johansson</p>
            </div>
            <section id="blog-section">
                <h2>What is professionalism?</h2>
                <p>Professionalism is the ability to contribute to a working environment respectfully and responsibly. Opposing prejudice towards people and backgrounds by engaging in a professional enviroment in which the primary focus is to produce the expected work.  It is about being truthful of your ability to do the work and follow through on your obligations and rectify any mistakes. Along with this, it also means you should follow the codes of conduct within your profession and the workplace. Integrity is part of professionalism. It is about doing the right thing even when no one is watching and aligning your actions with your words. 

                </p>
                <h2>Why does professionalism and integrity matter in the creative industries?</h2>
                <p>The creative industry is a very personally demanding industry. It is personal in the sense that creative people create concepts based of their imagination and ideas and can succeed or fail based of their creative and technical capabilities. Personal work can also be very dependent on the creative motivation; Ambition and passion can take creative projects to new heights. Therefore, I think its even more important to be professional within creative industries as it can be easier to be personally offended by critique. Having professionalism creates that barrier between the person and the person output as both parties understand that it is the work that's being valued. </p>
                <p>
                  Creativity and unique ideas are well sought after, therefore, integrity is required when working with such ideas and intellectual property. Integrity combats the biases and personal ambition that can and will affect a workplace environment and the reputation of a company. This can also have legal consequences when, for instance, the lack of integrity leads to stealing or selling trade secrets for their own benefits.  
                </p>
                <p>
                  Furthermore, integrity puts a standard on how work should be produced and how to behave in a professional setting. By choosing an ethical software developer you know that you will receive a high standard of work and engagement, creating an inviting and respectable collaboration. This shows that the company values and respect their clients which positively affects the company’s reputation within the industry. The same goes for you as an individual! 
                </p>

                <h2>Codes of Conduct</h2>
                <p>
                  Ethical behaviour is commonly enforced in software development by following codes of conduct or pillars of professionalism. Different methodology and frameworks exist to help these behaviours be exercised. These frameworks are mainly used as project management tools to help efficiency and collaboration in the workplace. SCRUM and Agile are two examples of this. However, the values remain more or less the same throughout these frameworks.

              <h2>SCRUM & Agile work enviroments</h2>
              <h3>The 5 values of SCRUM</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Openness – Being open and honest about your ability to perform and produce work is highly important to combat latency by identifying possible issues in a project. It lets your team members know what to expect from you and what they can do to help. Team leaders’ transparency will help set up a collaborative environment from the start.</li>
                <li>Courage – With openness comes courage. You show courage by being honest and asking for help. But also standing up if you believe something to be done differently. Team leaders can be great examples by standing up to stakeholders and demanding clients who are unaware of the software development process.</li>
                <li>Respect – Just as mentioned earlier, respect is crucial when engaging with fellow co-workers and their contributions.</li>
                <li>Focus – To reach the common goal, every team member needs to be focus on the work to be done. By minimising the number of tasks at a time allows more focus on the current task. Engaging together in team meeting can help motivation to stay focused.</li>
                <li>Commitment – Commitment is shown by working together as one unit. Trusting each other to contribute their best work and working towards achieving the common goals. </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Agile, like scrum, also has values they follow. The 4 values of Agile is:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</li>
                <li>Working software over comprehensive documentation</li>
                <li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</li>
                <li>Responding to change over following a plan</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Agile also have 12 principles. To name a few: </h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Providing motivated individuals with the environment and support they need and trusting them to get the job done.</li>
                <li>Welcoming changing requirements, even late in a project./li>
                <li>Assembling the project team and business owners daily throughout the project.</li>
                <li>Having the team reflect at regular intervals on how to become more effective, then tuning and adjusting behaviour accordingly</li>
              </ul>
