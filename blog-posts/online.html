                <h1>Creating a good online presence</h1>
                <p>Tuesday, 27 September 2022</p>
                <p>by Frida Johansson</p>

                <h2>Why should you have an online presence?</h2>
                <p>Having an online presence is an active method of connecting with clients, peers, and future employers by promoting and displaying yourself and your work. By being available and active online enhances your chances of being noticed and pursued professionally. An online presence can just start out as a documentation of your progress learning a new skill. Eventually, with time and resilience your new skill will have improved to the point of employability. Additionally, with this documentation, employers will be able to see your progress and your hard work getting to where you are now, showing your potential within the field. On the other hand, being part of an online community allows you to connect with peers with similar interests. This can help you motivate and improve your work by discovering new ideas and techniques.</p>


                <h2>What is the best approach for a software developer?</h2>
                <p>
                    There are multiple approaches that work, however, there are a few key steps which will speed up your chances of building a successful online presence. 
                    Who are you as a professional? What is your skillset? And who is your audience? 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="blog-text">Username -</span> To start off with, sticking with a simple memorable username is a great first step to be recognised online. Nowadays, many people in the creative industry are more commonly known by their online alias due to their large presence online. Having the same username everywhere will allow interested users to easily find you elsewhere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="blog-text">Platform -</span> Having multiple platforms is great for reaching a wider audience, however, it can be time consuming being active on each and every one of them. To begin with, by identifying your audience, your skillset, and the purpose of the platform will help you direct your attention to the right place. Having one platform where most of your content, updates, and audience interaction go is a sufficient way to keep your brand active and audiences interested. Along with this platform, having a more passive, up to date, portfolio website allows for more professional audiences to take a closer look at your best work and experience. And if your purpose is to get established and employed in the industry, having a LinkedIn page is a must!
                </p>

                    <dt><a href="#">Using a website builder </a></dt>
                    <dd>If web development is not your thing then you can create a website using a website builder like WordPress or Wix.</dd>

                <p>
                    <span class="blog-text">Personify your online presence -</span>  Lastly, the most difficult part is finding the quirk about yourself, what makes you unique and memorable? Just like why should I go to this café when there are others like it? Being personable but professional will make viewers want to stay and see what you do next. Moreover, employers will take note of your effort and how you market yourself, so suit your brand not just to the casual viewers but to the employers you want to notice you. 
                </p>
                <p>    
                    <span class="blog-text">So, how do you personify your brand?</span> Having a logo, signature or profile picture is an effective way to associate you with your work. Having a cohesive appearance gives audiences another reason to remember and recognise you. Display a professional version of your personality, include interest or humour to your projects and online posts. For software developers such as programmers, it can be hard to establish a cohesive online presence as projects can take multiple shapes and sizes compared to a character illustrator who has an establish art style. The focus is then more on your skillset and personality interacting with the community. 

                </p>

                <h3>Remember! With time comes experience, you will notice what works and what doesn’t and change accordingly. </h3>

                <h2>What work should you include and what should you exclude?</h2>
                <p>
                    To start off with, any work and display of technical experience is great for finding your first job. However, tailoring to the industry or job that you’re applying for will help employers see your potential working for their company. If you want to develop cinematic games, showcase your ability and passion for storytelling through your portfolio. Or if you want to be a web or mobile developer, include project made for an imaginary client showing your solutions to their needs and brand. Always document your initial vision of a project, the process, the struggles you faced and how you solved them, the outcome and what you wish you would have done better.
                </p>

                <div>
                    <h2>Before you go</h2>
                    <p>Remember to set short-term and long-term goals before you start planning and building your online presence.  These will help you stay on track to achieve your ideal career. Set goals based of learning and advancing hard and soft skills to suit the industry but also put time aside to work on passion projects. Learning fun niche skills will make you stand out from the crowd and demonstrate your ambition and passions and might teach you a transferable skill or two. These goals should also be relevant to you as a brand and your online presence.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Ask yourself: </h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Where do I see myself in the next 5, 10 years and how can my online presence help achieve that vision?</li>
                        <li>What is my ideal workplace? </li>
                        <li>Do I want to eventually set up my own company? </li>
                        <li>Do I want to build a large following online or is it just a tool to document my work?</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
