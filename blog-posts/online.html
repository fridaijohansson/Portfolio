                <h1>Creating a good online presence</h1>
                <p>Tuesday, 27 September 2022</p>
                <p>by Frida Johansson</p>

                <h2>Why should you have an online presence?</h2>
                <p>Having an online presence is an active method of connecting with clients, peers, and future employers by promoting and displaying yourself and your work. By being available and active online enhances your chances of being noticed and pursued professionally. An online presence can just start out as a documentation of your progress learning a new skill. Eventually, with time and resilience your new skill will have improved to the point of employability. Additionally, with this documentation, employers will be able to see your progress and your hard work getting to where you are now, showing your potential within the field. On the other hand, being part of an online community allows you to connect with peers with similar interests. This can help you motivate and improve your work by discovering new ideas and techniques.</p>


                <h2>What is the best approach for a software developer?</h2>
                <p>
                    There are multiple approaches that work, however, there are a few key steps which will speed up your chances of building a successful online presence. 
                    Who are you as a professional? What is your skillset? And who is your audience? 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="blog-text">Username -</span> To start off with, sticking with a simple memorable username is a great first step to be recognised online. Nowadays, many people in the creative industry are more commonly known by their online alias due to their large presence online. Having the same username everywhere will allow interested users to easily find you elsewhere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="blog-text">Platform -</span> Having multiple platforms is great for reaching a wider audience, however, it can be time consuming being active on each and every one of them. To begin with, by identifying your audience, your skillset, and the purpose of the platform will help you direct your attention to the right place. Having one platform where most of your content, updates, and audience interaction go is a sufficient way to keep your brand active and audiences interested. Along with this platform, having a more passive, up to date, portfolio website allows for more professional audiences to take a closer look at your best work and experience. And if your purpose is to get established and employed in the industry, having a LinkedIn page is a must!
                </p>

                    <dd>If web development is not your thing then you can create a website using a website builder like WordPress or Wix.</dd>

                <p>
                    <span class="blog-text">Personify your online presence -</span>  Lastly, the most difficult part is finding the quirk about yourself, what makes you unique and memorable? Just like why should I go to this café when there are others like it? Being personable but professional will make viewers want to stay and see what you do next. People are naturally seeking a connection to their consumption, and this translates into marketing. Seeing IKEA advertisement that takes place within a home during everyday life creates relatability with the benefit of marketing their furniture. The same goes for you as a brand. People want to feel connected to you and your work, especially within the creative industry. 
                </p>
                <p>    
                    <span class="blog-text">So, how do you personify your brand?</span> Having a logo, signature or profile picture is an effective way to associate you with your work. Having a cohesive appearance gives audiences another reason to remember and recognise you. Display a professional version of your personality, include interest or humour to your projects and online posts. For software developers such as programmers, it can be hard to establish a cohesive online presence as projects can take multiple shapes and sizes compare to a character illustrator who has an establish art style. The focus is then more on your skillset and personality interacting with the community. 

                </p>

                <h3>Remember! With time comes experience, you will notice what works and what doesn’t and change accordingly. </h3>

                <h2>My Experience</h2>
                <p>As a hobby artist, I have my fair share of experience building an online presence for my artwork. Having used Instagram and currently using reddit as my platform of choice. I recently started learning how to draw digitally and decided to get involved in a reddit community to motivate me. This community provides a place for anyone to showcase their character idea in hopes of it being drawn by a hobby or professional artist, for free. Having regularly contributed to the community throughout summer all while improving my skillset as a digital artist, I eventually got my first digital art commission. This proves my previous point, that using a platform for the intent of documenting the learning and improving of a new skill, will help establish you within a community and eventually lead to that skill being employable.
                However, this will look slightly different as I’m starting my software development career. Instead, my motivation and focus will be to establish myself as a professional. I will boost my employability by advancing my hard and soft skillset to suit the industry standards. Using LinkedIn and building a portfolio website to showcase my best work. Alongside having a twitter account dedicated towards showcasing the progress of my skills whilst making connections within the community. This is also where my personality and interests will be on display to personify my brand. By gaining work experience and naturally creating industry connections, I can then choose to specialise in what I found the most interesting and fun.
                </p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>When building a successful online presence, you cannot just focus on what you want to learn but you also have to be updated with the trends and the industry standards. Having niche interests are great for building a unique brand, however, for a sustainable future within the industry, especially when starting out, a wide skillset of your specific industry will allow more chances at establishing yourself within your chosen discipline. For example, having multiple programming languages and technologies under your belt will create a wide range of work opportunities to choose from. By building up your CV with experience and having naturally created industry connections, you can then choose to specialise in what you found the most interesting and fun. </p>
